only street type:
the crescent

street names have punctuation:
lamey's mill road
bella-vista st
angler's place
captain's cove
st. margarets st
kings lynn st - does anyone write king's lynn st?

several street names have more than one piece:
point grey road, for example

rather than trying to distinguish and apply rules differently between "pender st west" and "e kent st north", consider just normalizing them to "PENDER ST WEST" and "W PENDER ST", or "E KENT ST NORTH" and "N E KENT ST" and searching for both

Note that there is a "n grandview highway" but a "grandview hwy south" - consider normalizing this when you do your import. Normalize other things as well.
Normalizing data:
st. -> saint
div -> diversion
hwy -> highway
something south -> s something
other thing north -> n other thing
remove apostrophes

What if I just treated WEST BOULEVARD as if it was a street name of '' with a direction and a type?
Then I'd turn WEST BOULEVARD into W BOULEVARD - meaning I'd have to change that in the DB.

remove street number
uppercase
remove punctuation
identify and remove directions at the front - use a recursive function and keep removing pieces (and creating a string from them) until there are no more
identify and remove directions at the back
identify and remove type from the back
rebuild: number + back direction + front direction + street name + type

for each function, return the result and the remaining pieces
if the result is null, return an empty string
